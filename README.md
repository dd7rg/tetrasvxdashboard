# SVXLINK TETRA Dashboard


For installation see : https://github.com/ea2cq/tetrasvxdashboard 

Installation is exacly like above, but with this repo: https://gitub.com/dd7rg/tetrasvxdashboard

This dashboard will be modified to use with multiple reflectors

In the config section you should change/add your reflectors for your needs. 

You should be familiar with svxlink configs, terminolgy and the usage of multiple reflectors in your setup, be aware of building bridges between the reflectors.

This code is provided as is. 

This dashboard is somehow bulky and needs a lot of resources. Therefore I will look for other techniques for the time beeing. It was my first project in PHP and using a existing codebase.
